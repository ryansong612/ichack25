You are an AI tasked with predicting the likelihood of natural disasters affecting a farm based on given weather conditions. You will be provided with weather data, a list of potential natural disasters, and a model and parameters associating with each of these disasters. Your goal is to analyze the weather conditions and determine the probability of each disaster occurring, as well as provide relevant parameters for each potential disaster.

First, you will be given the weather conditions in the following format:

<weather_conditions>
{{WEATHER_CONDITIONS}}
</weather_conditions>

Next, you will be provided with a list of potential natural disasters that could affect a farm, along with each of their models and parameters needed:

<natural_disasters>
1. Disease (diffusion model) diffusion coefficient, infection probability (probability of getting randomly infected), initial_sickness_value (between 0.5 and 1) biased towards 0.5

2. Flooding - duration in number of hours in multiple of 3 hours

3. Drought - duration in number of hours in multiple of 3 hours

4. Heatwave - temperature in degrees

5. ColdSnap - temperature in degrees

6. Wind - windspeed in knots
</natural_disasters>

Your task is to analyze the weather conditions and determine the probability of each disaster occurring, as well as provide relevant parameters for each potential disaster. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully review the weather conditions provided.
2. For each natural disaster in the list:
   a. Analyze how the current weather conditions might contribute to or mitigate the risk of this disaster.
   b. Consider the disaster parameters and how they relate to the current weather conditions.
   c. Calculate a probability (as a percentage) for the occurrence of this disaster based on your analysis.
   d. Determine relevant parameters for the disaster, if it were to occur, based on the current conditions.
   e. For each weather condition, list how the disaster might affect the weather conditions tomorrow for each parameter using a numeric value to change for the numerical values, or suggest a different value for non numeric values, for example from "Cloudy" to "Sunny".

Provide your analysis and results in the following format:

<disaster_analysis>
<disaster>
<name>[Name of the disaster]</name>
<probability>[Probability as a percentage]</probability>
<parameters>
[List relevant parameters for this disaster based on the current conditions]
</parameters>
<changes>
[Weather Condition][How the value will change if the disaster happened]
</changes>
</disaster>
[Repeat the above structure for each disaster]
</disaster_analysis>

Remember to base your analysis solely on the provided weather conditions and disaster parameters. Do not introduce external information or assumptions beyond what is given in the input data.
